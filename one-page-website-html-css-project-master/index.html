          <h2>Description</h2>
          <p>I am a 4th-year Information Technology undergraduate at the Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology and an Associate Software Engineer at ZTurn Inc. My main objective is to balance work and life while achieving career success. Modules like 'Employability Skills Development' and 'Preparation for the Professional World' have been instrumental in developing essential professional skills. These courses taught me formal writing, telephone etiquette, interview skills, and more, helping me stand out in the industry. I am continuously adapting to grow and excel in my career, aiming to climb the career ladder in my field.</p>
        </p>

          <div class="icon"><img src="https://img.icons8.com/bubbles/100/000000/services.png" /></div>
          <h2>Feelings</h2>
          <p>Initially, I wasn't interested in attending the PPW module lectures due to my job and focus on other modules. However, completing the first assignment made me realize its value in preparing for the professional world. The engaging lectures caught my attention, and I began attending regularly. Applying skills like formal writing at work boosted my confidence and satisfaction. This step-by-step improvement made me feel more professional and prepared for the industry.</p>
        </div>

          <div class="icon"><img src="https://img.icons8.com/bubbles/100/000000/services.png" /></div>
          <h2>Evaluation</h2>
          <p>Reflecting on the PPW module, I realized I initially underestimated its importance due to work and academic commitments, including my Research Project. Interacting with business professionals inspired me to improve my skills. Midway through, I recognized my poor time management was a barrier. Submitting the first assignment highlighted the module's value, teaching me essential skills like formal writing, telephone etiquette, and business email writing. Applying these skills at work boosted my confidence and professionalism, better preparing me for the industry.</p>
        </div>

          <div class="icon"><img src="https://img.icons8.com/bubbles/100/000000/services.png" /></div>
          <h2>Analysis</h2>
          <p>For my first submission, I reviewed lectures on learning log writing, formal writing, and presentation skills. This improved my understanding of formal writing and overall writing quality. Despite some presentation experience, the module taught me how to structure content effectively for impactful presentations, essential for office calls. 

            I realized the need for better time management and consistent effort rather than relying on last-minute reviews. With the rise of remote work, skills in formal writing, email composition, and telephone etiquette became crucial. The module helped me correct email mistakes and enhance my professional communication.
            
            The course also allowed me to assess and develop leadership skills and improve report writing for both work and academic purposes. By the end, I saw a significant improvement in my writing, communication, presentations, and leadership. I now feel more confident and capable in my professional role, with a clear vision for my future in the industry.</p>

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>Recognizing my lack of prioritization and time management was key. Adjusting midway through the course helped me gain valuable knowledge. Applying what I learned at work boosted my skills and interest. Real-world application is crucial for improvement. Grateful for the module despite it not being directly related to my field. It enhanced my professional skills and confidence for career advancement.</p>

          <h2>Action Plan</h2>
          <p>Moving forward, I'll prioritize effective time management and continuous skill practice. Ongoing growth is vital for staying competent. I've gained confidence in applying these skills professionally and inspiring others. Adapting to new trends like remote work is crucial. I'll focus on refining professional skills for success and to set an example for others.</p>

        <h2>Step 1 – Current role and responsibilities
          </h2>
        <p>As a 4th year undergraduate specializing the field of Information Technology and parallelly working as Software Engineer associate after completing my 6-month internship as a Software Engineer intern. The proper course content and timeline planning helped me to find a job in the field I wish to persuade right before I graduate. As this field new to Sri Lanka and its really competitive I feel that the knowledge I got through SLIIT will not be enough in another year where I would have to learn more tools and technologies and gain more experience in solving many use cases. As I see more and more people are trying to enter into this field as it as great growth I must make sure that during the first few years of my career I get the maximum experience so that I can be a value to the organization which I am working as well and which would create a demand for my skills set and professional attitudes which I possess and which I inculcate during the industrial exposure.</p>

        <h2>Step 2 – Career goal</h2>
        <p>
          I'm deeply passionate about Information Technology as it empowers businesses to tackle complex challenges and maximize their potential by leveraging their most valuable data. My goal is to advance in my career within this field, gaining the necessary understanding, experience, and exposure. I aim to reach a senior software engineer position where I can lead technically and contribute significantly. Ultimately, I aspire to provide consultancy services, helping businesses optimize their systems and processes through innovative software solutions as a technical lead.

        <h2>
          Step 3 – Skills gap
          </h2>
        <p>To reach my desired goal, I need to start by analyzing my weaknesses and identifying areas where I can improve. Firstly, I realize that I lack exposure to various tools and technologies relevant to my job role. It's essential for me to gain hands-on experience with these tools and explore related technologies in the field. Experience will come with time, so I need to dedicate myself to working in this field to not only add years to my CV but also to solve more problems and gain valuable insights.

          I also notice that I tend to hesitate when facing new challenges. Balancing academic responsibilities and office tasks sometimes makes me reluctant to take on additional challenges. However, tackling challenges will not only broaden my expertise but also expand my network as I connect with more professionals in the field.
          
          Moreover, I need to assess my personal skills and attitudes to identify areas for improvement. I've realized that I lack some professional skills, especially highlighted during the PPW module. It's crucial for me to practice and apply what I've learned in courses and actively seek opportunities to enhance my skills further.
          
          To achieve my goals, I must become more proficient in time management. There are instances where I struggle to prioritize tasks when overwhelmed with work. Improving my time management skills will help me handle workload more effectively and efficiently.

        <div class="icon"><img src="https://img.icons8.com/bubbles/100/000000/services.png" /></div>
        <h2>Step 4 – Actions, roadmaps with smart objectives</h2>
        <p>Specific: Gain expertise in all areas related to software engineering with deep knowledge.

          Measurable: Utilize my current work environment to master new skills, tools, and technologies through hands-on experience with projects.
          
          Achievable: Set weekly or monthly goals to learn a new technology or master a specific skill, ensuring consistent progress.
          
          Relevant: Achieving this objective will qualify me for advancement in my software engineering career and enable me to progress up the career ladder.
          
          Timely: Keep track of my learning progress, experiences, and projects solved within reasonable timeframes to continually add value toward my main career goal.
